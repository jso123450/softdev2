Aim: Canvassing the nabe (neighborhood) with DOM and HTML5
DoNow: What did advent of DOM achieve? What did it NOT achieve?
- a kind of standard (consistency) for web designers to follow
- it attempted to have websites render the same way / properly in diff browsers

BUT -> it did NOT accomodate multimedia aspects

Web v1.0
- when was this ?? they kinda skipped over this
- static
- consume as a user

Web v2.0
- when this was announced -> "what happened to 1.0??"
- dynamic
- post content (like Facebook)
- interct with others

MULTIMEDIA was annoying
- if you wanted to use like Flash you would have to install it on each browser
- a lot of plugins

Why NOT Flash on iOS?
- a lot of CPU usage that could eat the battery of your portable device in 10mins
- Flash is CLOSED source - danger of bad coders
- herpderp goodbye Flash

PAIR PROGRAMMING
- 1 keyboarder
- 1 co-driver
- 2 thinkers

HTML5
- canvases!!!
  - height, width, id
