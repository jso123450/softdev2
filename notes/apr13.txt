DYNAMIC PROGRAMMING ("dynamic optimization")
- solving a complex problem by solving its component subproblems just once
  and storing their solutions

MEMOIZATION
- technique of storing solutions to subproblems to avoid recomputation
OR
- use of caches to retrieve previously computed values to reduce time
  complexity of algorithms
