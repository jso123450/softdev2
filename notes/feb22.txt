Aim:

Setting up Submods
1. Make new GitHub repo for SoftDev hw

2. Clone main repo
$ git clone git@github.com:stuy-softdev/workshop.git

3. Navigate to your period's directory, and...
$ git submodule add <HTTPS LINK> <first_last>

4. Commit and push to main repo
$ git pull; git commit -a -m "<COMMIT MSG>"; git push

5. Remove workshop 
$ rm -rf workshop

window.requestAnimationFrame(<fxn>)

* Tells browser to run specified fxn before drawing next frame
* Allows browser to handle when code should be executed
(as opposed to setInterval which is based on specific times)
* Allows browser to pause animation when a page is not in foreground
* Fxn must call requestAnimationFrame() to animate another frame at next repaint
Browser will attempt to run 60 fps
